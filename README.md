Abdul Hadi Ahmed

My name is Abdul Hadi Ahmed, and I am passionate about technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. 
I enjoy exploring how computers work and how programming can be used to create useful, efficient, and innovative solutions.
I am particularly interested in:
C and C++ for building a strong foundation in programming concepts such as memory management, data structures, and algorithms.
Python for its simplicity and versatility in fields like data analysis, automation, and machine learning
My long-term goal is to strengthen my programming skills, contribute to open-source projects, and eventually work on larger-scale software applications that can make a real-world impact.
